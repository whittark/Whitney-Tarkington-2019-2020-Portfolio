# Whitney Tarkington 2019-2020 Portfolio Site
Welcome to my site! Take a tour of recent development projects and plans to leverage what I'm learning within the technical communications space.

## Release Notes
I'm working on a new layout that introduces parallax elements. In experimenting, a great deal was added to my style.css; I'll be cleaning that up. This under development feature may also have affected hamburger menu functionality.
