## CV Note
The CV link opens my LinkedIn page. I have some years within the software industry and will need more than a week to strategize a full content update.

## Acknowledgements
I studied the paralax layout that tanuj10 used here: https://github.com/tanuj101/Parallax-website-template. I created my own based on his layout.

Inspiration for card sections and page footers is from Creative Tim's free "Gaia" template: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/gaia-bootstrap-template
